# Fluff_T6_Scripts

Quality-of-life and gameplay scripts for the FLUFF T6 server.  
This repo contains experimental server-side GSC scripts. Some features are incomplete or unstable.

## Scripts
### scripts\mp\hits.gsc
Goal: calculate bone hit percentage.  
Status: broken. Needs logic fixes and validation.

### scripts\mp\main.gsc
Primary server QOL script.  
Features: core tweaks and nuke-related behavior.  
Status: mostly working. Killfeed handling is currently broken.

### scripts\mp\norpg4bots.gsc
Goal: remove launchers from bots when they join.  
Status: not working correctly. Join handling or weapon strip logic needs rework.

## Stability Notes
